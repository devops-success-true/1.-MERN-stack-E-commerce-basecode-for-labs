# MERN E-commerce Base Repository

This repository hosts the **base code** of a MERN stack e-commerce application.  
It is used as the foundational code for a series of **DevOps and cloud infrastructure projects**, demonstrating end-to-end application deployment, orchestration, automation, and monitoring across multiple environments.

## Intended DevOps Projects & Implementations

This code serves as the starting point for the following implementations:

### Monolithic Deployments
- **Local VM:** Deployed on VirtualBox VMs.  
- **Cloud (AWS & Azure):** High availability (HA) and fault-tolerant monolithic deployment.

### Containerization & Orchestration
- **Docker:** Single-container deployment on VMs.  
- **Docker Compose:** Multi-container orchestration for the app and services.

### Kubernetes Deployments

**Amazon EKS (AWS)** – Production-grade cluster with:  
- **Access & Security:** RBAC, Service Accounts, OIDC, IAM integration  
- **Ingress & Networking:** Ingress controllers with ALB integration  
- **Autoscaling:** HPA for pods, Cluster Autoscaler & Karpenter for dynamic nodes  
- **Secrets & Config:** AWS Secrets Manager / Parameter Store

**Azure AKS (Azure)** – Production-grade cluster with:  
- **Access & Security:** RBAC, Azure AD authentication, OIDC with Managed Identities  
- **Ingress & Networking:** Ingress controllers with Application Gateway (AGIC)  
- **Autoscaling:** HPA, Cluster Autoscaler, optional KEDA for event-driven scaling  
- **Secrets & Config:** Azure Key Vault integration

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Terraform:** Modular, reusable, environment-agnostic templates for AWS & Azure

### Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- **GitHub Actions:** Automated pipelines for build, test, and deployment  
- **Azure DevOps Pipelines:** Enterprise-grade CI/CD workflows

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Metrics & Visualization:** Prometheus + Grafana  
- **Logging & Analysis:** LOKI & ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

This repository reflects the full DevOps lifecycle: from local development to production-ready cloud deployments, including automated CI/CD, infrastructure provisioning, container orchestration, and monitoring.
